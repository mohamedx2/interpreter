# Logo Implementation Status

## Current Status: ⚠️ In Progress

The logo implementation for hamroun.exe has been attempted with multiple approaches but the icon is not yet visible in Windows Explorer.

## What We've Tried:

### 1. ✅ Icon File Creation
- Created `hamroun.ico` with French flag theme (blue, white, red)
- Added "H" letter for Hamroun identification
- File size: 1118 bytes

### 2. ✅ Resource Tools Tested
- `rsrc` tool - Creates .syso files for Go
- `go-winres` tool - Modern Windows resource tool
- `goversioninfo` tool - Version info and icon embedding

### 3. ✅ Build Process
- Successfully created `rsrc_windows_amd64.syso` 
- Go build completes without errors
- Executable functionality preserved

## Current Issue:
The icon is not visible when checking with PowerShell's `ExtractAssociatedIcon` method, suggesting the embedding process isn't working correctly.

## Next Steps to Try:
1. Create a proper ICO file using a professional tool
2. Try embedding with different resource compilers
3. Test with a known-good ICO file
4. Verify Go build is picking up the .syso file

## Files Created:
- `hamroun.ico` - Custom icon file
- `rsrc_windows_amd64.syso` - Resource file for Go
- Various .json and .rc configuration files

## Functionality Status: ✅ Working
- hamroun.exe executes .hamroun files correctly
- REPL mode works with enhanced UI
- All French programming features functional
